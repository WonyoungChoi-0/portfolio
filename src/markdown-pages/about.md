## About Me 
  
<br>Hello, my name is Wonyoung Choi. I am an engineering computer science student at the University of Virginia. I am also minoring in technology entreprenuership and I will be graduating in May 2022.

I am interested in working on projects that range from building websites to creating mobile applications that have an emphasis on user interaction. I aim to create products that are fast, functional, and visually appealing.

I am always open to learning new technologies that improve the functionality and efficiency of the projects that I work on.
